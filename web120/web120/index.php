 <p>Hi everyone! I moved to Seattle from Michigan about 5 years ago for new opportunities and I have definitely found them since I have been here! I enjoy sports of all kinds, cooking, travel, the outdoors and spending time with my dog, Bear. He made the trip out here with me and is quite well travelled.</p>
 <p>I am now in my 3rd quarter here at Seattle Central and thoroughly enjoying learning how to become a software developer and network engineer. I hope to learn as much as I can about programming and IT to be able to start a lucrative career with a company that will allow me to work anywhere I choose. My long term goal is to get into Cyber Security as a penetration tester.</p>
