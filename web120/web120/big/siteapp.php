<p>Some would say running a responsive website is more beneficial that a native mobile app. Some would turn the table and argue the other way around. I am here to give you the benefits of both of them and let you decide for yourself. With more mobile traffic now than ever before, making sure you have a working app on mobile devices is key to success, be it a web app or native. </p>

<p>With a responsive design, your design is of lower cost. You are making one version of your app across all platforms making it cheaper than creating a separate app just for mobile. However with native mobile apps, the code does run faster since the app is designed for a mobile experience. Native mobile apps show up in the app store, whereas a responsive website does not have an ‘app’ persay. Responsive websites require less maintenance than mobile apps while native mobile apps make it easier to add new features. </p>

<p>Responsive websites are good for improving your SEO. “Having a single responsive website rather than separate desktop and mobile versions avoids the issue of duplicate content, which can negatively impact your search ranking.(Arsenault)” Native mobile apps tend to work better with mobile hardware, since that was what they were designed for. They also more commonly work offline, something that is less likely with responsive websites since they need to be connected to the internet. </p>

<p>Responsive websites do provide an improved browsing experience since users will not have to zoom in and out constantly to be able to see the content of the site. Native apps do provide an experience users would expect, “web apps are made to look like native apps, they don’t perform like them. They also present a single, generic UI across all platforms – which rarely match the UX customers have come to expect on their device. If your app feels awkward or strange, customers will avoid using it.(Todaro)”</p>

<p>Both experiences have their benefits and pitfalls, it’s up to you to decide which is more fitting of your customer base. I would personally design a responsive web app first, then later on develop a mobile app separately that would function on its own, giving the user a choice of experience.</p>
